# KodeUI - A pure code UI system for Unity

This was created to enable the creation of mods UI in Kerbal Space Program without the need of pre built UI exported as AssetBundle
Original concept from Tim Twice Circled [Megaquarium Vlog#12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LNn8Ot8Mrw)

## How to use

Load in Unity 2017.1.3p1 and import the free TextMesh Pro asset from the store. Select the UIMainCanevas object and use the Build UI from the UITester component to create a demo UI.

## TODO
 - More components
 - Replace the Resources.Load calls
 - Ressources loading for Sprites
 - Component Styles and Skinning
 - Layout improvement
 - Proper UI Skin
 - Build script for the KodeUI subdir
